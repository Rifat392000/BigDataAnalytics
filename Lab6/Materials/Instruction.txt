Given the following input file, you must write MapReduce programs in Java to do the following.

1. Find the occurrences of each page (numbered as 1, 2, 3, and so on). 
2. Find the most visited page. You may use the output file generated from Question 1 as an input file to solve this problem.
3. Find the least visited page. You may use the output file generated from Question 1 as an input file to solve this problem.
4. Find the frequency of pairs. In this case, remove the duplicate numbers from each transaction as a data pre-processing step. Use the concept of Java set for removing duplicates.


After solving a problem, show your solution to the instructor and later, submit a report showing the screenshots of execution of each problem.
